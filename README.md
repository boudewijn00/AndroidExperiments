it al started as an experiment to build a user friendly calendar for kids growing up in 2 houses. for this i had to render a calendar view, with the canvas. after almost a year its more my central project for Android experiments. containing the following features:

- account manager
- retrieving data from google (calendar) API
- JSON parsing
- custom fonts
- sd storage
- custom (list) views
- canvas
- sensors (accelerometer)
- async http (get/ post)
- voice record
